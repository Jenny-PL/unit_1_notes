# OOP (Object Oriented Programming) 

OOP is a new way of  arranging data.  It includes defining classes (with a **class name, attributes, and methods**). 

Some classes we've already seen are string, boolean, and list... all have specific things in common and can do specific actions (methods, which just means functions that are specific to a class).

- **Object**: an instance of a class.  Each object or instance has its own space in memory & can have distinct attributes.
- **Attribute**: a specific variable defined within a class (example: 'dog' is an object of the string class, and its state or attribute is that it has 3 characters: d-o-g).  Attribute is related to state.   
- **State** includes all the attributes, or variables, within a class.  
- **Behavior**: the functions (aka **methods**) that are defined within a class.

- Side note: in the terminal, use **dir(variable_name)** to get a list of methods available for that class.  Also, **help(class_name)**, ie **help(str)** or **help(list)** will give more info about the class and its methods.
