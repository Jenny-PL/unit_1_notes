# Plan for week One:
1. Set some habits:
    - Do work/study before class
    - As I learn, write notes in markdown.
    - Re-write notes as codepen using HTML,CSS?
    - Meet with a classmate, practice teaching each other what we learned.
2. Figure out communte to Ada: DONE
3. Figure out how to upload notes & codepens to GitHub: INITIATED.

### Notes from Day one: ###
*To do:* 
- figure our how to change zoom background?

Other notes:
1. There is an option to **send a message later** in slack.
---
## Learning to Learn ##
1. Tip: When reading a programming book
 - When you get to a code sample, read it over
 - Then close the book.
 - Then try to type it up.


# Questions from this week #
1. How can I upload my files to GitHub?
2. Will I be able to transfer files from my local computer to another computer?
3. Command Line:
   1. man
   2. mv: moves a file. syntax: mv filename destination path 
   > mv Markdown_Syntax.md ~/Developer/projects/classroom/random_notes
   3. cat: concatinates text?
   4. echo
   5. grep: let's you search for text in files
   6. https://wizardzines.com/comics/#bite-size-command-line
4. Memory [class on this](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/3167/blocks/1032/content_files/intro-to-dev-environment/intro-to-computer-memory.md)
   1. CPU: Central processing unit
   2. RAM: Random-access memory (fast, holds data temporarily)
   3. Volatile memory: RAM is volatile, as it can't hold data permenently
5. Errors
   1. **Runtime Errors** = This is a new concept for me. This is when the program finds an error as it runs.  It may be due to trying to do something Python can't do (divide by zero), or trying to find a file or item in list/dict that doesn't exist, or due to calling a function with incorrect spelling or referring to a variable that wasn't previously defined.

## Homework Q: ## 
1. None.  Kinda confused about this still
   
2. Parameters/arguments: Does this define the variable? (Example below)
   
        def happy_birthday(name, from_name):
            code

        happy_birthday('Taylor', 'Mom')

In code above, Does the function signature w/paremeters allow us to define a function by passing it into the function as an argument? (ie- name = 'Taylor", from_name = "Mom")?
> Answer: YES, however scope is limited to the function. (local variable)
